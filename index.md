Hello! Emily here.  Welcome to my robot page!  Here are some (fun) facts about me: 

* I'm a senior studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell
* I think self-driving cars are super cool and I'd like to work on one 
* I play badminton and tennis 
* I'm currently learning the guitar as my quarantine hobby (I started with the ukulele in March) and I secretly aspire to be an internet sensation someday
